        <p><b>Neural Structured Learning (NSL)</b> is a new learning paradigm to train neural
        networks by leveraging structured signals in addition to feature inputs.
        Structure can be explicit as represented by a graph or implicit as
        induced by adversarial perturbation.</p>
        <p>Structured signals are commonly used to represent relations or similarity
        among samples that may be labeled or unlabeled. Therefore, leveraging these
        signals during neural network training harnesses both labeled and unlabeled
        data, which can improve model accuracy, particularly when <b>the amount of labeled
        data is relatively small</b>. Additionally, models trained with samples that are
        generated by adding adversarial perturbation have been shown to be
        <b>robust against malicious attacks</b>, which are designed to mislead a model's
        prediction or classification.</p>
        <p>NSL generalizes to <a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub46568.pdf">Neural Graph Learning</a> as well as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf">Adversarial Learning</a>. The NSL framework in TensorFlow provides the following easy-to-use
        APIs and tools for developers to train models with structured signals:</p>
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
          <li><b>Keras APIs</b> to enable training with graphs (explicit structure) and adversarial pertubations (implicit structure).</li>
          <li><b>TF ops and functions</b> to enable training with structure when using lower-level TensorFlow APIs</li>
          <li><b>Tools</b> to build graphs and construct graph inputs for training</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Incorporating structured signals is done only during training. So, the performance of the
        serving/inference workflow remains unchanged. More information on neural structured learning
        can be found in our <a href="tutorials/framework">framework description</a>. To get started,
        please see our <a href="install"> install guide</a>, and for a practical introduction to
        NSL, check out our <a href="tutorials/framework#step-by-step_tutorials">tutorials.</a></p>
